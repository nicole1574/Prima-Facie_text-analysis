# Theoretical Framework & Research Design

## Theoretical Approach

- **Untranslatability (不可转译性):** Draws upon translation studies (Apter, 2013), feminist legal theory, and trauma studies to conceptualize how embodied experience resists legal codification.
- **Legal Epistemic Violence:** The adversarial system's evidentiary logic as a gendered filter that excludes fragmented, affective testimony.
- **Performance and Narrative:** The monologic structure of *Prima Facie* foregrounds the crisis of voice and agency in the courtroom.

## Methodology Overview

- **Qualitative:** Close reading of both parts, focusing on narrative rupture, identity shift, and discursive breakdown.
- **Quantitative:** Use NLP to extract and compare features (legal terms, sentence complexity, emotional tone, trauma markers) across sections.
- **Integrative:** Results inform a new understanding of untranslatability in legal and theatrical texts.

## Key Analysis Dimensions

1. **Lexical Diversity** (TTR, MTLD)
2. **Legal Terminology Frequency**
3. **Syntactic Complexity** (sentence length, fragments, subordinate clause rate)
4. **Emotional Tone** (sentiment analysis)
5. **Trauma Markers** (tense shift, repetition, ellipsis, sensory language)
